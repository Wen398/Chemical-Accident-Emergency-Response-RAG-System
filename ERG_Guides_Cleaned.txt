of the fissile properties of the materials. Alternatively, the fissile nature of the contents is indicated by a criticality
safety index (CSI) on a special FISSILE label or on the shipping paper.
•	 Some radioactive materials cannot be detected by commonly available instruments.
•	 Water from cargo fire control is not expected to cause pollution.
FIRE OR EXPLOSION
•	 These materials are seldom flammable. Packages are designed to withstand fires without damage to contents.
•	 Radioactivity does not change flammability or other properties of materials.
•	 Type AF, IF, B(U)F, B(M)F and CF packages are designed and evaluated to withstand total engulfment in
flames at temperatures of 800°C (1475°F) for a period of 30 minutes.
PUBLIC SAFETY
•	 CALL 911. Then call emergency response telephone number on shipping paper. If shipping paper not
available or no answer, refer to appropriate telephone number listed on the inside back cover.
•	 Priorities for rescue, life-saving, first aid, fire control and other hazards are higher than the priority for
measuring radiation levels.
